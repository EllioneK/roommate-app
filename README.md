Roommate
========

The Roommate Android Application is a handy app that will let you keep track 
of available rooms within a building. Wasting no time searching for available rooms
and minimize the danger to interrupt lectures or similar events.
Search for rooms with specified properties and display the schedule plans at your convenience.
<br><br>
The schedule plans for Buildingfiles can be created online in our editor
on www.roommateapp.info and easily transfered and synchronised to your Android device.
The sourcecode of the webservice will also become available later this year after it was
ported over to ZF2.
<br><br>
This application was created during the winter-semester 2012/13 at the Westf√§lische Hochschule
by six computer sience students in the context of a project class.
The Roommate Android Application will be released under the GPLv3 licence.
